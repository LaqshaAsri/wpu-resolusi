Hello sir, nice to meet you

My Resolution : 
I want to be a programmer, save money, marry an ordinary woman, who is neither beautiful nor ugly, and have two children, the first child is a girl, the second child is a boy. I will retire as a programmer when my daughter gets married and my son is settled. Then, I will enjoy retirement. Then, I died at an old age before my wife. Living like that would be fun.
